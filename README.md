# Remote-Session-Killer

Identify user session on remote machine and kill that session.

In corporate environment with domain, download the script and run with account with admin privileges.

You will be asked for hostname of computer connected to domain in your company. Then sessions on host will be displayed.
Choose the ID session and kill type: reset or logout. Sessions will be listed again to verify if it was killed.

Thats all. May be useful for service desk operators.
